# election-16

I was curious how county population and political voting correlate, so I decided to crunch the data. This repository contains the code I used to build up the data I need. Election data came from [Tony McGovern](https://github.com/tonmcg/County_Level_Election_Results_12-16/) on Github and population estimates came from the [U.S. Census](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2016/demo/popest/counties-total.html)
